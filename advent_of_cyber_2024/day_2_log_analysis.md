# Lessons Learned from Advent of Cyber 2024 - Day 2

## Exercise Title: *"One man's false positive is another man's potpourri"*

The Day 2 exercise focuses on distinguishing between **false positives** and genuine security threats within a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**. Below are the key lessons learned:

### 1. Understanding False Positives
- **False positives** are alerts that indicate a threat where none exists.
- They can lead to:
  - Wasted resources.
  - Overlooking genuine threats due to cluttered alerts.

### 2. Identifying False Positives
- SOC analysts must scrutinize alerts to determine their validity.
- Techniques include:
  - Analyzing log data.
  - Understanding normal system behavior.
  - Recognizing anomalies.

### 3. Tools and Techniques
- Using **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** systems to:
  - Aggregate and correlate data.
  - Provide a centralized view of alerts.
- Applying **threat intelligence** to contextualize and validate alerts.

### 4. Impact of False Positives
- Excessive false positives can result in **alert fatigue**, causing:
  - Analysts to become desensitized to alerts.
  - Potentially missing genuine threats.
- Emphasizes the need to fine-tune detection systems for better accuracy.

### 5. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly update detection rules to enhance system precision.
- Incorporate feedback and ongoing training for SOC analysts to stay effective in identifying and mitigating false positives.
