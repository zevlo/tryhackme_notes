# Lessons Learned from Advent of Cyber 2024 - Day 7

## Exercise Title: *"Oh, no. I'M SPEAKING IN CLOUDTRAIL!"*

The Day 7 exercise focuses on utilizing **AWS CloudTrail** to monitor and investigate suspicious activity within an AWS environment. The key lessons learned include:

### 1. Understanding AWS CloudTrail
- **Definition**: AWS CloudTrail provides event logging for AWS accounts, enabling security teams to track user activity and detect anomalies.
- **Purpose**: To enhance security and compliance by providing a history of AWS API calls and related events.

### 2. Investigating Suspicious Activities
- **Log Analysis**: Reviewing CloudTrail logs to identify unauthorized or anomalous actions, such as accessing resources, creating users, or modifying permissions.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `eventSource`: Indicates the AWS service responsible for the event.
  - `userIdentity`: Details the user or entity that initiated the action.
  - `sourceIPAddress`: Provides the IP address associated with the request.

### 3. Common Threats in AWS Environments
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized users gaining elevated access rights.
- **Account Compromise**: Exploiting credentials to perform malicious actions.
- **Misconfigured Resources**: Missteps in setup leading to data exposure or security breaches.

### 4. Best Practices for AWS Security
- **Enable CloudTrail**: Ensure continuous logging for all regions.
- **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review logs for suspicious activity using SIEM tools or AWS services like CloudWatch.
- **Implement Least Privilege**: Assign users the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Automate Responses**: Use AWS Lambda to trigger alerts or remediation actions based on CloudTrail events.
