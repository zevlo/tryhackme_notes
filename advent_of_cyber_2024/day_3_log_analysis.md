# Day 3: *"Even if I wanted to go, their vulnerabilities wouldn't allow it."*

The Day 3 exercise focuses on identifying and mitigating **vulnerabilities** within systems to prevent exploitation by malicious actors. The key lessons learned include:

### 1. Understanding Vulnerabilities
- **Definition**: Weaknesses or flaws in a system that can be exploited to compromise security.
- **Types**:
  - **Software Vulnerabilities**: Bugs or flaws in software code.
  - **Configuration Vulnerabilities**: Improper system settings.
  - **Human Vulnerabilities**: Susceptibility to social engineering attacks.

### 2. Vulnerability Assessment
- **Purpose**: Identify and evaluate vulnerabilities within systems.
- **Methods**:
  - **Automated Scanning**: Using tools to detect known vulnerabilities.
  - **Manual Testing**: In-depth analysis by security professionals.

### 3. Common Vulnerabilities
- **Injection Flaws**: e.g., SQL injection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious scripts executed in a user's browser.
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Exploiting flaws in object deserialization processes.

### 4. Mitigation Strategies
- **Regular Patching**: Keeping software up to date.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Developing code with security in mind.
- **Configuration Management**: Ensuring systems are securely configured.
- **User Training**: Educating users on security best practices.

### 5. Importance of Continuous Monitoring
- **Proactive Detection**: Identifying vulnerabilities before exploitation.
- **Incident Response**: Quickly addressing security breaches.
